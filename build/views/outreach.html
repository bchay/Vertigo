The day before the competition, Brendan helped set up the fields and electronic systems necessary for the following day of matches. It was an engaging and rewarding experience being able to help other teams diagnose their issues, as well as being an invaluable learning opportunity. The night before the tournament, he also performed field inspection, and made sure each team had a fully functioning robot. During the tournament itself, he worked as an FTA, and oversaw matches, as well as helped teams with individual electronic or programming problems.
</p><h2>Demoed at the FRC Midwest Regional at University of Illinois at Chicago</h2><p>Brendan and Benny both taught students and mentors at the Midwest FRC regional what FTC was about by bringing robots and allowing others to drive them. Additionally, they explained the goals and basics of FTC and FIRST. They engaged in discussions about how the program is similar to FRC, how they are different, and most importantly how to build a robot. They spoke to numerous FRC teams, as well as members of the community who were interested in learning more about FTC.
</p><h2>Presented FIRST RES-Q robot to Accurate Metal Fabricating</h2><p>Accurate Metal Fabricating, a metal fabricating company in Chicago, Illinois, gave us the opportunity to present our robot to their team of engineers. After the presentation, they critiqued the robot and asked about our building process. We explained that it involved significant prototyping and eventually building to determine what would work. The engineers recommended that next season we CAD the entire robot before building. Doing so would allow everyone to be on the same page and to iron out any possible issues with the robot before any building occurs. Also, Accurate Metal Fabricating permitted us to use their laser cutter to design custom parts. 
</p><h2>Demoed robot at Museum of Science and Industry Block Party</h2><p>Benny went to the Block Party event at the Museum of Science and Industry. He demoed past robots and explained about FIRST, as well as the robots and the engineering process. This was also a good opportunity to connect with the Chicago community. He met several kids that were involved in FTC and they spoke about the year’s experiences. Children walking by got an opportunity to drive the robot; this got them excited about robotics and STEM.
</p><h2>Helped the Israeli team come to the World Championship</h2><p>On April 1st, Team TwisT, FTC team 11056, from Yeruham Israel, advanced to the FIRST World Championship and invited us to join them. Benny traveled to the World Championship, and helped them when they were unable to drive their robot on shabbat. We also housed the team so that they could come to America before the Passover holiday.</p><p>After the team arrived from the airport, we adjourned to our workshop at Highland Park High School to reassemble their robot after the flight. During this process, we introduced them to the high school and our families. After putting the robot together, the Israeli team went to Benny's house for a Passover barbeque. There, they were introduced the team to the Sister Cities Foundation of Highland Park, the organization helped plan their trip to the United States.</p><p>On April 26th, the Israeli team left for the world championships in St. Louis, Missouri. When we got to the hotel, he met up with the FRC team from Yeruham, the Y Team. We continued to work on the robot and tried to perfect the autonomous. Additionally, Benny helped to translate the phones to english to enable more streamlined communication with Team TwisT’s alliance partner. That night, he also taught the team the importance of scouting. Due to the small number of teams in Israel, scouting plays a minuscule role in the tournaments. The group put together a scouting notebook and designated two people to watch the matches of both alliance partners and opponents.</p><p>The next day, the team continued working on their autonomous program. The difficulty was exacerbated due to lack of a field. They made several different programs to test on the practice fields the next day. Benny spent his time helping the TwisT Team scout and strategize with the other teams.
</p><h2>Made practice robots to teach programing</h2><h2>Demoed robot at College of Lake County Robotics Festival</h2><p>Brendan, Adam, and Benny went to the College of Lake County to participate in their annual robotics fair. They demoed robots from the FIRST RES-Q season, but ran into several issues. Mainly, forgetting controllers and USB On The Go cables As such, it was only possible to demo one robot at a time. This problem notwithstanding, we had a great time. </p><p>They saw two other FTC teams, and spoke about the season. They connected with members of the local community, and taught them about the essence of FIRST. During this time, Vertigo was interviewed by a medical engineer from Baxter, including about FTC and FIRST.
</p><h2>Taught class to Solomon Schechter students</h2><p>We taught a class to 3rd and 4th grade children at Solomon Schechter Day School of Metropolitan Chicago about teamwork. There were over 50 kids in attendance, and they all enjoyed it. We worked with them on team building projects and communication skills when solving problems. First, the children formed groups and were tasked with building a tower of spaghetti and marshmallows. We went around helping them problem solve so that the tower would stand on its own, and we had brainstorming sessions with the students. After all groups completed the project, each group talked about their difficulties and how they were overcome. We told them that brainstorming a problems solving is something we do a lot on the team and that is the most critical step in engineering. We went on to show the robots from previous years and let the students drive them. We explained how they worked, and how to control and drive the robots. 
</p><h2>Taught class at Lincoln Elementary school</h2><h2>Demoed at Rainbow PUSH</h2><p>Brendan visited the Rainbow PUSH convention to demonstrate robots and explain about the mission of both FTC and FIRST. There were numerous adults who stopped by to look at the robots, as well as many children who were interested. Everyone got a chance to drive the robot, as well as several smaller demo bots that our team had previously made. Several went beyond solely driving and were able to hang the robot on the cliff bar.
</p><h2>Programmed Robot for Comcast commercial</h2><p>Brendan programmed a robot for a Comcast commercial, wherein a student is attempting to build a robot. The robot had been built for a FTC competition several years previously, but lacked the proper programming. He added the ability to drive and move the scissor lift. During the shooting, he was given the opportunity to become an extra. Throughout the day, he introduced numerous people to FIRST, and spoke to several others who had been a part of the program.
